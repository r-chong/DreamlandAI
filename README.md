## My Experience with Langchain ü¶úÔ∏èüîó
Working with Langchain has been a great experience. The library offers an intuitive and powerful way of generating text using AI models, allowing me to experiment with different styles and structures, resulting in a more variable development experience. In particular I focused on the chaining feature, which I used to chain together the initial prompt to the adventure itself, and the latter chaining to decision-making chain.
